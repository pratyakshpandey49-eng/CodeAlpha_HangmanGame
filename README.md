## Overview

This is a classic word guessing game called **Hangman**, where the player tries to guess the letters in a hidden word. The player has a limited number of incorrect guesses before the game ends.

The game selects a random word from a predefined list and prompts the player to guess letters. Correct guesses reveal the letters in the word; wrong guesses reduce the remaining attempts.

## How to Play

1. The game randomly selects a word.
2. The player guesses one letter at a time.
3. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in the correct positions.
4. If the letter is not in the word, the player loses an attempt.
5. The game continues until the player guesses the entire word or runs out of attempts.

## Features
